## useState
I was familiar with this react hook so I did not face togh challenges in this one. I just read the document to check if I remebered it correctly and then used it in my system.

## useEffect
I was also familiar with this hook as I have worked with it before. but I kind of found it hard to define so I read the document again and understood the hook more clearly. I then figured out I can Integrate it with my application

## useRef
I was not familiar with this hook before. So I read about it thouroghly. This for me was more tough as I had no idea about what it is or its importance. but I believe I have succesfully used it and I have tried to integrate it into my system
